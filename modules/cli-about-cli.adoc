= About the CLI

With the {product-title} command-line interface (CLI), you can create
applications and manage {product-title} projects from a terminal. The CLI is
ideal in situations where you:

* work directly with project source code.
* script {product-title} operations.
* are restricted by bandwidth resources and can not use the web console.

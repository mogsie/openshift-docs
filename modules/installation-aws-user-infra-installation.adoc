the cluster installation:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir=<installation_directory> wait-for install-complete <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information.

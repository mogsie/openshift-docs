= Creating a migration plan in the {mtc-short} web console

You can create a migration plan in the  for the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

.Prerequisites

* The source and target clusters must have network access to each other and to the replication repository.
* If you use snapshots to copy data, the source and target clusters must run on the same cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and be located in the same region.

.Procedure

. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Migration plans*.
. Click *Add migration plan*.
. Enter the *Plan name* and click *Next*.
+
The *Plan name* can contain up to 253 lower-case alphanumeric characters (`a-z, 0-9`). It must not contain spaces or underscores (`_`).
. Select a *Source cluster*.
. Select a *Target cluster*.
. Select a *Replication repository*.
. Select the projects to be migrated and click *Next*.
. Select *Copy* or *Move* for the persistent volume (PV):

. Select a *Source cluster*, a *Target cluster*, and a *Repository*, and click *Next*.
. In the *Namespaces* screen, select the projects to be migrated and click *Next*.
. In the *Persistent volumes* screen, select *Copy* or *Move* for the PVs:

* *Copy* copies the data from the PV of a source cluster to the replication repository and then restores it on a newly created PV, with similar characteristics, in the target cluster.
+
If you specified a route to an image registry when you added the source cluster to the web console, you can migrate images directly from the source cluster to the target cluster.

* *Move* unmounts a remote volume, for example, NFS, from the source cluster, creates a PV resource on the target cluster pointing to the remote volume, and then mounts the remote volume on the target cluster. Applications running on the target cluster use the same remote volume that the source cluster was using. The remote volume must be accessible to the source and target clusters.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Copy options* screen, select a *Copy method* for the PVs:

* *Snapshot copy* backs up and restores the disk using the cloud provider's snapshot functionality. It is significantly faster than *Filesystem copy*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The storage and clusters must be in the same region and the storage classes must be compatible.
====

* *Filesystem copy* backs up the files on the source cluster and restores them on the target cluster.

. You can select *Verify copy* to verify data migrated with *Filesystem copy*. Data is verified by generating a checksum for each source file and checking the checksum after restoration. Data verification significantly reduces performance.

. Select a *Target storage class*.
+
If you selected *Filesystem copy*, you can change the storage class during migration, for example, from Red Hat Gluster Storage or NFS storage to Red Hat Ceph Storage.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Migration options* screen, the *Use direct image migration* and *Use direct PV migration for filesystem copies* options are selected if you specified an image registry route for the source cluster.
+
Direct migration is much faster than migrating files and images with a replication repository.

. If you want to add a migration hook, click *Add Hook* and perform the following steps for each migration:

.. Specify the name of the hook.
.. Select an *Ansible playbook* or a *Custom container image* for a hook written in another language.
.. Click *Browse* to upload the playbook.
.. Optional: If you are not using the default Ansible runtime image, specify a custom Ansible image.
.. Specify the cluster on which you want the hook to run, the service account name, and the namespace.
.. Select the migration step at which you want the hook to run:

* PreBackup: Before backup tasks are started on the source cluster
* PostBackup: After backup tasks are complete on the source cluster
* PreRestore: Before restore tasks are started on the target cluster
* PostRestore: After restore tasks are complete on the target cluster

. Click *Add*.
+
You can add up to four hooks to a migration plan, assigning each hook to a different migration step.

. Click *Finish*.
. Click *Close*.
+
The migration plan appears in the *Migration plans* list.

= Upgrading the {mtc-full} Operator on an {product-title} 3 cluster

You can upgrade {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on an {product-title} 3 cluster by downloading the latest `operator.yml` file and replacing the existing {mtc-full} Operator.

[NOTE]
====
If you remove and recreate the namespace, you must update the cluster service account token in the {mtc-short} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Download the latest `operator.yml` file:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v{mtc-version-z}):/operator.yml ./
----

. Replace the {mtc-full} Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace --force -f operator.yml
----

. If you are upgrading from version 1.1.2 or earlier, delete the `Restic` pod to apply the changes:

.. Get the `Restic` pod names:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-migration | grep restic
----

.. Delete each `Restic` Pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod <restic_pod>
----

. If you are upgrading from version 1.2 or later, scale the `migration-operator` deployment to `0` to stop the deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=0 deployment/migration-operator
----

. Scale the `migration-operator` deployment to `1` to start the deployment and apply the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=1 deployment/migration-operator
----

. Verify that the operator was upgraded to the latest version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -o yaml -n openshift-migration get deployment/migration-operator | grep image: | awk -F ":" '{ print $NF }'
----

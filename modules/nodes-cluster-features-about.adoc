= Understanding feature gates and Technology Preview features

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource to enable Technology Preview
features throughout your cluster. This allows you, for example, to enable
Technology Preview features on test clusters where you can fully test them while
ensuring they are disabled on production clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After turning Technology Preview features on using feature gates, they cannot be
turned off and cluster upgrades are prevented.

////
If you disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present.

If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title}
displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.

== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is a feature providing the ability to run Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Getting support

You must have a subscription to receive support for the Red Hat WMCO. Deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported without a subscription. If you do not have a subscription, you can use the community WMCO, a distribution that lacks official support. Request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 1.0.2

This release of the WMCO provides initial support for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster.

WMCO supports clusters running on the following cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure

The following Windows Server operating systems are supported in the initial release of the WMCO:

* Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019

[id="wmco-1-0-1-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* If you have a cluster with two Windows nodes, and you create a web server deployment with two replicas, the pods each land on a Windows compute node. In this scenario, if you create a `Service` object with type `LoadBalancer`, communication with the load balancer endpoint is flaky. To mitigate this issue, you must use Windows Server 2019 with a version 10.0.17763.1457 or earlier. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905950[*BZ#1905950*])
